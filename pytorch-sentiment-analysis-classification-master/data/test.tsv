an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .	neg

proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report .	neg

the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .	neg
what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .	neg
the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .	neg

flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up .	neg
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces ' appeared in 1938 .	neg

earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .	neg
a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent .	neg

the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .	neg

the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .	neg
this thing works on no level whatsoever for me .	neg

'dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .	neg
hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .	neg
it does n't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .	neg
despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .	neg
it 's mildly amusing , but i certainly ca n't recommend it .	neg
in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .	neg
it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty .	neg
phoned-in business as usual .	neg

there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters .	neg
eh .	neg
the movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?	neg
. . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes ' word processor .	neg
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .	neg
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .	neg
there 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .	neg
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd .	neg

proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .	neg
there is no insight into the anguish of heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain , today 's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .	neg
the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .	neg
this is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned .	neg
less worrying about covering all the drama in frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .	neg

the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .	neg
it 's not that kung pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk 's impish augmentation .	neg
two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .	neg
when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger 's sex life , it already has one strike against it .	neg

the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .	neg
none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .	neg
the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .	neg
the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .	neg
some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .	neg
it 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .	neg
