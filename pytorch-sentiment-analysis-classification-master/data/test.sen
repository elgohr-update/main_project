this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well . 
queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater 
once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle . 
a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
it 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
execrable . 
a 'girls gone wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
good for a few unintentional laughs , `` extreme ops `` was obviously made for the `` xxx `` crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
it 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
[ allen 's ] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me . 
the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito 's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent . 
the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
marinated in clichs and mawkish dialogue . 
the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there 's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
if we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
the film 's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film 's production design . 
despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush . 
with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal . 
please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . 
the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level . 
both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they do n't fit well together and neither is well told . 
juliette binoche 's sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
[ it 's ] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin ' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale . 
the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
despite auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
'you 'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you 'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . ' 
the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola 's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about 
like schindler 's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me . 
has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
it virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
. . . a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made . 
a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
it 's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
several of steven soderbergh 's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
it 's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
you can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere . 
it drowns in sap . 
reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
[ t ] he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent . 
as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
[ davis ] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
the story the movie tells is of brian de palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` how does steven seagal come across these days ? `` or maybe `` how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? 
most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved 
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
where the film falters is in its tone . 
fails to bring as much to the table . 
dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit 
rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
conforms itself with creating a game of 'who 's who ' . . . where the characters ' moves are often more predictable than their consequences . 
even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi 's easy-going likableness . 
blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
mandel holland 's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
too clever by about nine-tenths . 
the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage . 
. . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
a little weak -- and it is n't that funny . 
a less-than-thrilling thriller . 
flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
there 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo mstico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensacin de inconformidad que hace pensar ms de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . ' 
too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 
the acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 
even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
it 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old . 
oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough 
the photographer 's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 
it 's just plain boring . 
this is n't even madonna 's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
it 's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
the master of disguise represents adam sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
there are some laughs in this movie , but williams ' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
one of the worst films of 2002 . 
[ jackson and bledel ] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
it 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . 
does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
replacing john carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like . . . but overall the halloween series has lost its edge . 
deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence . 
' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag do n't eat enough during the film . ' 
the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows . 
the movie turns out to be [ assayas ' ] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora 's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
a grating , emaciated flick . 
the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
an appalling 'ace ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit ' on their resumes in the future , that 'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
it recycles every clich about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
`` i blame all men for war , `` [ the warden 's daughter ] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland . 
i 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
it will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary . but here 's the real damn : it is n't funny , either . 
it 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it 's painful . 
. curiously , super troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report . 
the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
i hate this movie 
[ newton ] wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality . 
resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/ 
it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one . 
what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
it 's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
a film that loses sight of its own story . 
an awful lot like one of [ spears ' ] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces ' appeared in 1938 . 
feels shrill , simple and soapy . 
earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
the intent is almost exactly the same [ as the full monty ] . all that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject 
too simple for its own good . 
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author 's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad . 
they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book . 
well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless . 
directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name 
a chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
when the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails . 
as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
fairly run-of-the-mill . 
ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center . 
it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades 
welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters . 
an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 
the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
nelson 's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it 's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
'dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry . 
it does n't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
it 's mildly amusing , but i certainly ca n't recommend it . 
in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
phoned-in business as usual . 
involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
cassavetes thinks he 's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
a very average science fiction film . 
hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty . 
a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
pretend it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it 's fun , but it 's a real howler . 
there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
eh . 
the movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
. . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes ' word processor . 
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
there 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
if you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere . 
the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
has its moments , but it 's pretty far from a treasure . 
proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
there is no insight into the anguish of heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain , today 's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
this is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned . 
less worrying about covering all the drama in frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
it 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . ' 
if only it were , well , funnier . 
the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
it 's not that kung pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk 's impish augmentation . 
two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger 's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
it 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant ' because of that . 
time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` clockstoppers , `` but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain . 
none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point . 
the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
it 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure . 
to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green 's half-hearted movie career . 
rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
the overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
do n't even bother to rent this on video . 
while we want macdowell 's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
however stale the material , lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
a well-acted , but one-note film . 
while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes . 
dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . 
busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence 
lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
a selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
it 's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm 's shelf . 
automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
do not see this film . 
is it a comedy ? a drama ? a romance ? a cartoon ? 
if it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than half past dead . 
ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard ca n't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
there 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh . 
rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let 's get this thing over with ' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
it 's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .

the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
it 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable .

if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving .

too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .

a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert 's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .

the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
. . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .

even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
the action clichs just pile up .

goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .

earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
while howard 's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .

it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
this remake of lina wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero .

its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
there 's plenty of style in guillermo del toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create . 
horrible

birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` unfaithful . `` why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .

corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny 
full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters . by that measure , it is a failure . 
gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichs . 
costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier .

ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would .

an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title .

black-and-white and unrealistic .

this movie . . . does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .

starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
the truth about charlie is that it 's a brazenly misguided project . 
hey arnold ! the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing . 
opens as promising as any war/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` glory : a soldier 's story . ``
