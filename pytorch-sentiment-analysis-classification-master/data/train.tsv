nothing more than a mediocre trifle .	neg
one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters .	neg

while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's animal house .	neg
the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .	neg
too silly to take seriously .	neg
guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .	neg
ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .	neg
jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company .	neg
what is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .	neg
if jews were catholics , this would be catechism	neg
`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy .	neg

a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie .	neg
the movie 's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .	neg
a supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .	neg
denis o'neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .	neg
trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead .	neg
the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .	neg
millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .	neg
impostor is a step down for director gary fleder .	neg
a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing .	neg
the film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .	neg
a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .	neg
sluggish , tonally uneven .	neg
demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh .	neg

pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal .	neg

not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .	neg
apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .	neg
everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .	neg
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .	neg
the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .	neg
the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .	neg
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .	neg
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving .	neg
shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story .	neg
that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .	neg
it 's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .	neg
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .	neg
muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner .	neg
this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .	neg
simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .	neg
a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '	neg
an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .	neg
sandra bullock 's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot .	neg
all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .	neg

as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling .	neg
too ordinary to restore [ harmon ] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience .	neg

an often unfunny romp .	neg
. . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .	neg
essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality	neg
plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .	neg
as plain and pedestrian as catsup --	neg
. . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .	neg

though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .	neg
some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he 's the most obvious one .	neg

it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .	neg

this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .	neg
for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time .	neg

downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler `` pg-13 rating .	neg

manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .	neg
any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .	neg

the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list .	neg
this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .	neg
although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .	neg

its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more .	neg
with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp .	neg

the plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .	neg
reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .	neg
the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants ' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .	neg
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .	neg

intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .	neg
some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .	neg
a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash .	neg
they threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .	neg
the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story .	neg
it 's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments .	neg
in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .	neg
the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel is n't the actor to save it .	neg
i 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich .	neg
the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .	neg
while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee 's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .	neg
delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas .	neg
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .	neg
the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .	neg
. . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .	neg
hollywood ending just is n't very funny .	neg
the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .	neg
is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful .	neg
a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .	neg
the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it 's just a kids ' flick . ' translation : 'we do n't need to try very hard . '	neg
squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .	neg
it 's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .	neg
a little too pat for its own good .	neg
it treats women like idiots .	neg
witless and utterly pointless .	neg
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments .	neg
avary 's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis ' book .	neg
i 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake .	neg
. . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland .	neg
every note rings false .	neg
. . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else .	neg
safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye .	neg
stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .	neg
just like hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .	neg
blue crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be .	neg
a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [ besson 's ] earlier work .	neg
crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls .	neg
the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots .	neg
there 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .	neg
i 'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but it 's stupid .	neg
human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard .	neg
while some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .	neg
there is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .	neg
the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .	neg
spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations	neg
as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .	neg
verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .	neg
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .	neg
the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .	neg
the christ allegory does n't work because there is no foundation for it	neg
one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .	neg
it tells more than it shows .	neg
poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .	neg
much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .	neg
bang ! zoom ! it 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places .	neg
the comedy is nonexistent .	neg
rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .	neg
no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way .	neg
a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at .	neg
bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .	neg
while [ hill ] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .	neg
trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .	neg
call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .	neg
the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .	neg
needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .	neg
like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz .	neg
just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing .	neg
fluffy and disposible .	neg
a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .	neg
you can practically smell the patchouli oil .	neg
simplistic , silly and tedious .	neg
more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .	neg
nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .	neg
so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .	neg

while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire .	neg
an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .	neg
the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct .	neg
yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '	neg
i 've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .	neg
the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers .	neg
pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .	neg
will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .	neg
a well-acted movie that simply does n't gel .	neg
helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' tv and revenge .	neg
i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .	neg
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire .	neg
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .	neg
a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .	neg
it 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly .	neg
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .	neg
the script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .	neg
in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .	neg
vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship .	neg
we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .	neg
deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .	neg
its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .	neg
crummy	neg
an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s .	neg

hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .	neg
unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .	neg
anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '	neg
it 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s .	neg
a few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .	neg
forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .	neg

at the bottom rung of the series ' entries .	neg
the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime ' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids .	neg
it 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental .	neg
most of the action setups are incoherent .	neg
it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you 're in need of a cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through .	neg
a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .	neg
while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .	neg
. . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .	neg
so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .	neg
the fact that the 'best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .	neg

the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast is n't the least bit mesmerizing .	neg
watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen .	neg
'sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it 'challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .	neg
whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .	neg

shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .	neg
`` what john does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , `` one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia .	neg
there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .	neg
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .	neg

this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .	neg
none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with `` xxx `` is that its own action is n't very effective .	neg
quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?	neg
it 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .	neg
it 's got the brawn , but not the brains .	neg
'opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .	neg
essentially `` fatal attraction `` remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . .	neg
the whole talking-animal thing is grisly .	neg
the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .	neg
a chiller resolutely without chills .	neg
in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .	neg
an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic .	neg
the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .	neg
eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal .	neg
my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .	neg
even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie .	neg
it 's an awfully derivative story .	neg
the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .	neg

no surprises .	neg
put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob 's body of work .	neg
we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .	neg
it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe 's misunderstanding of marivaux 's rhythms , and mira sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .	neg
sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .	neg
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .	neg
the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .	neg
all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .	neg
a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin 's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison .	neg
too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .	neg
snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .	neg
to my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .	neg
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .	neg
. . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .	neg
i can imagine this movie as a b & w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .	neg
bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .	neg
with zoe clarke-williams 's lackluster thriller `` new best friend `` , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .	neg
an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .	neg
has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .	neg
after you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .	neg
a one-trick pony whose few t & a bits still ca n't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable .	neg
despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .	neg
[ plays ] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .	neg
while there 's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer	neg
for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless .	neg
represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre .	neg
it 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .	neg
the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joff and demi moore 's the scarlet letter .	neg
lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis .	neg
a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .	neg
it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .	neg
even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser .	neg
one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before .	neg
a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .	neg
nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .	neg
the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .	neg
throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material .	neg
the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .	neg
the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .	neg
i ca n't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .	neg
if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice 's novel the vampire chronicles .	neg
needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance .	neg
makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .	neg
the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .	neg
buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichs and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block .	neg
everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .	neg
the film is flat .	neg
it 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .	neg
uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things .	neg
not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .	neg
it 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .	neg
it 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni .	neg
the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material .	neg
given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .	neg
eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .	neg
instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture	neg
a sour , nasty offering .	neg
while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .	neg
an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .	neg
brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation .	neg
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan 's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .	neg
the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada .	neg
a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [ seagal 's ] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat .	neg
i loved looking at this movie . i just did n't care as much for the story .	neg
mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that 's because relatively nothing happens .	neg
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .	neg
we have n't seen such hilarity since say it is n't so !	neg
there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .	neg
the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming .	neg
too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle 's carpets .	neg
historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .	neg
loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .	neg
the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .	neg
with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .	neg
there 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .	neg
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .	neg
to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . .	neg
taken as a whole , the tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot .	neg
nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too .	neg
it 's not without its pleasures , but i 'll stick with the tune .	neg
coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .	neg
initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama .	neg
it does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .	neg
tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .	neg
the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .	neg
better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .	neg
without shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish .	neg
in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's forget paris . but even then , i 'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes .	neg
a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .	neg
this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .	neg
a bit of an unwieldy mess .	neg
if you saw benigni 's pinocchio at a public park , you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .	neg
ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action .	neg
maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we did n't .	neg
contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .	neg
what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .	neg
while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river 's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby 's main overall flaw .	neg
does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago .	neg
writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .	neg
by-the-numbers yarn .	neg
it 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .	neg
sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .	neg
the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum 's good intentions .	neg
. . . overly melodramatic . . .	neg
a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .	neg
the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years .	neg
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .	neg
a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .	neg
