the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth . 
nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives .

too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could 've been an impacting film . 
a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again . 
the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
does n't amount to much of anything . 
eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting . 
if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) .

there 's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichd , doddering , misogynistic boy 's club . 
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
well-made but mush-hearted . 
it 's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
something must have been lost in the translation . 
like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
though harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
it 's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
. . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
it 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings . 
writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away ' sinks . 
lurid and less than lucid work . 
the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
as steamy as last week 's pork dumplings . 
the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
. . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
this time kaufman 's imagination has failed him . 
there 's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino 's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
it 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end . 
none of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy . 
cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
the emperor 's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . . 
it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre 
the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i ca n't remember a single name responsible for it . 
'abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' . . . you should definitely let dante 's gloomy words be your guide . 
whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky . 
tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it . 
you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
it 's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 
the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized . 
both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
. . . stale and uninspired . 
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . 
bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 
the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film 's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 
nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . 
while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's animal house . 
the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie . 
too silly to take seriously . 
guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing . 
jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company . 
what is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
if jews were catholics , this would be catechism 
`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy . 
as an actor 's showcase , hart 's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen . 
murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense . 
a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
the movie 's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
a supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
denis o'neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead . 
the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
the film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art . 
sluggish , tonally uneven . 
demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh . 
is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes . 
apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable . 
the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story . 
that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
it 's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . ' 
an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . 
sandra bullock 's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot . 
all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull . 
a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line . 
the film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
a semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays . 
i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 
for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding . 
i 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i do n't see the point . it 's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
. . . salaciously simplistic . 
though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
it 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound . 
a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo n't seem like such a bore . 
mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito 's way . 
yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling . 
if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
all of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
the script ? please . 
these people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities . 
white has n't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else . 
it 's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
too ordinary to restore [ harmon ] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience . 
while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari 's film falls short in building the drama of lilia 's journey . 
a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special . 
a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
teen movies have really hit the skids . 
denzel washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there 's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
the movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth . 
it 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
you know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
it made me feel unclean , and i 'm the guy who liked there 's something about mary and both american pie movies . oh , and booty call . 
like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it ca n't escape its past , and it does n't want to . 
lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
the whole film has this sneaky feel to it as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
barely goes beyond comic book status . 
director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel . 
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
you 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous . 
it 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buuel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
i ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it . 
the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
it 's just rather leaden and dull . 
though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression . 
narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone 's guess . 
if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
mildly entertaining . 
a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it . 
an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse . 
ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor 's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
. . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . 
the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . 
not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny . 
it 's exactly the kind of movie toback 's detractors always accuse him of making . 
. . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
there 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . 
to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
it 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . 
a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material . 
brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
it 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
. . . hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor . 
this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 
trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the `` gadzooks ! `` 
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart 's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
according to wendigo , 'nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
it 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary . 
bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . 
what 'blade runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
i admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
a quaint , romanticized rendering . 
a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer . 
the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace does n't organize it with any particular insight . 
just plain silly . 
aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there 's little to be learned from watching 'comedian ' 
trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering . 
the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar . 
there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
. . . hokey art house pretension . 
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i have n't encountered since at least pete 's dragon . 
a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
i ca n't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
the movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture . 
exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair . 
chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together 
its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
an awkward hybrid of genres that just does n't work . 
a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
feels familiar and tired . 
it 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . 
a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
it 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
[ davis ] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters . 
the redeeming feature of chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine . 
like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire 's bright side . 
these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
there 's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
kapur 's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself . 
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 
almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that 's a liability . 
summer 's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 
sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
it 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . . 
the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally . 
it 's just a little too self-satisfied . 
the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls . 
the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way . 
once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back . 
the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained . 
a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't . 
the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .

i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits 
a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise .

it 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death 
a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 
a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness . 
simply does n't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .

the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . 
[ the kid 's ] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .

the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
it 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 
perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
the project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor . 
the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes . 
i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
if you think it 's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman 's clothes , then you 'll enjoy the hot chick . 
the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable , but the results are uneven .

hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading . 
little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [ eyre 's ] first film something of a sleeper success . 
who are 'they ' ? well , they 're 'they ' . they 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like `` they 're back ! `` , `` they 're out there ! `` and `` they 're coming ! `` 
what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . 
if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
the best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
interesting , but not compelling . 
the film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver 
kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning .

entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
. . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
at its best , it 's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it 's rambo- meets-john ford . 
due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
it 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
it just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . 
so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises 
when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray 's game of chinese whispers with mr bean . 
a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
`` abandon `` will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
. . . tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i do n't know what she 's doing in here . . . 
philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
could n't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ? 
human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 
this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
enough similarities to gymkata and howie long 's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
oozes condescension from every pore . 
a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist ' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
dreary tale of middle-class angst 
better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery . 
a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 
the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol . 
grating and tedious . 
scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichs from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian 's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it 's not even a tv special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy 's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
the problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
it 's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
below is well below expectations . 
like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
it 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
. . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . 
director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10 , 000 times . 
it 's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
draggin ' about dragons 
it 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what 's the point ? ' 
if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
[ denis ' ] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 
the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
just a bloody mess . 
director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` the longest yard `` playbook like a checklist . 
frankly , it 's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller 's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there 's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
reyes ' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it 's undone by a sloppy script 
its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` chicago `` in 2002 . zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a 
a tough go , but leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
. . . delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story . 
villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi 's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
. . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
although huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
an uninspired preachy and clichd war film . 
it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow 's car . 
opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot . 
it 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie 's hideous yellow 'do . 
a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
[ janey ] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
maid in manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
it 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
the film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
would n't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here 's a movie about it anyway . 
this u-boat does n't have a captain . 
while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
degenerates into hogwash . 
like a can of 2-day old coke . you can taste it , but there 's no fizz . 
as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine . 
a pint-sized 'goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest . 
despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 
showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
. . . feels as if ( there 's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie ' posturing . 
an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it . 
pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . 
the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . ' 
blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
it 's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
woefully pretentious . 
unfortunately , it 's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . 
the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany ' does n't necessarily mean 'funny . ' 
manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
what madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
benigni presents himself as the boy puppet pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and american breckin meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice . 
while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
it 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
the film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . 
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
there 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film . 
the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
i 'm not saying that ice age does n't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there 's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . 
a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching . 
even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud . 
this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just does n't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
`` analyze that `` is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .

a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
. . . if you 're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee .

a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn . they were right .

haneke 's script ( from elfriede jelinek 's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
there is so much plodding sensitivity .

resident evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail .

so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
i 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
[ p ] artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .

ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
the movie bounces all over the map . 
a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man . 
some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen .

for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical `` or `` suck `` into a sentence . 
a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you 're going to alter the bard 's ending , you 'd better have a good alternative . 
first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .

the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult . 
a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 
the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much sense even on its own terms . 
bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer . 
been there done that . 
kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
. . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller . 
i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .

whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney 's 'top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 
at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it 
all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
a feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .

a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .

snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him 
amid the clich and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura 's best work since the xfl . 
there 's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
it 's a frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be . 
a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with . 
the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes 
offers absolutely nothing i had n't already seen . 
dignified ceo 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
much of what is meant to be 'inspirational ' and 'uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [ the movie 's ] mindset . 
becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't . 
a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i 've ever seen . 
a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .

alex nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
rather less than the sum of its underventilated pre-fils confrontations . 
yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn .

a dreadful live-action movie . 
as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
. . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time . it 's a trifle . 
schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
this overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .

eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants . 
amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . `` 
a relative letdown . 
where last time jokes flowed out of cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore 's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crme brle . 
77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
[ seagal 's ] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's razzie . 
the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
this rough trade punch-and-judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now . 
originality is sorely lacking . 
a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing . 
they presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept  a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
i 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? ' 
screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through . 
it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b . s . one another and put on a show in drag . 
a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [ woody allen ] has made in the last twenty years . 
tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple  he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
there 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . 
this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
the innocence of holiday cheer ai n't what it used to be . 
plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
. . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
amazingly lame . 
the movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . ' 
for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [ sci-fi ] rehash . 
knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail . 
it 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 
what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
i did n't laugh . i did n't smile . i survived . 
the film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
it 's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
whereas last year 's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
stephen earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text  when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv 's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
we get the comedy we settle for . 
the irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . 
[ a ] poorly executed comedy . 
filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
at once half-baked and overheated . 
what 's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
no movement , no yuks , not much of anything . 
a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh 's best films , `` erin brockovich , `` `` out of sight `` and `` ocean 's eleven , `` never were . 
only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors 
spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen . 
insufferably naive . 
the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
the film , like jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie 's peter pan . 
eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
this is really just another genre picture . 
cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that 's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
it 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that 's precisely what arthur dong 's family fundamentals does . 
all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
a lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable . 
serving sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs . 
fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients . 
for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . 
the director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either . 
deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . 
it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly . 
after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r & b names and references . 
passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
hawke 's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
report card : does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement . does n't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
it 's not only dull because we 've seen [ eddie ] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny . 
according to the script , grant and bullock 's characters are made for each other . but you 'd never guess that from the performances . 
ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film 's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . 
imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you 've imagined the ring . 
this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there 's very little hustling on view . 
the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
everyone 's to blame here . 
it is n't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie if only it were that grand a failure ! it 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
empire ca n't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it does n't work as either . 
it 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
has all the depth of a wading pool . 
its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
a coarse and stupid gross-out . 
apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
entertaining enough , but nothing new 
does n't really add up to much . 
a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort 
illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller . 
plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
the gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook . 
the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater . 
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
the phone rings and a voice tells you you 've got seven days left to live . then you get another phone call warning you that if the video is n't back at blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees . o . k . , not really . 
innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
while the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other . 
from beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film . 
a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia 
the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers ' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but was n't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor . 
there 's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt 's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
all the queen 's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal 's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double . 
sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
none of birthday girl 's calculated events take us by surprise . . . 
audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
the new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the `` saving private ryan `` battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension . 
gere gives a good performance in a film that does n't merit it . 
a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script . 
some of seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
the movie does n't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .

the words , 'frankly , my dear , i do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . 
like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .

what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !

the performances are so leaden , michael rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
the whole thing 's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
'rare birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
hart 's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .

in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it 's too bad nothing else is . 
it 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
is n't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii ' just does n't cut it . 
bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film 
wait for it to hit cable . 
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
the fourth in a series that i 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
painfully padded . 
nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichs and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg 's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water ' story . you 've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around . 
all the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi . 
the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
there 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
i 'm just too bored to care . 
as social expos , skins has its heart in the right place , but that 's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous . 
jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . 
one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
there 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
it 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
not even the hanson brothers can save it 
skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source . 
the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters . 
swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
wes craven 's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street ' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . ' 
it does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch . 
the film 's center will not hold . 
a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast . 
on the right track to something that 's creepy and effective . . . it 's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy . 
it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .

tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
godawful boring slug of a movie . 
hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
just is n't as weird as it ought to be . 
hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
it 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy 's sledgehammer sap . 
well made but uninvolving , bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
it 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana 's future . 
[ sam 's ] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . 
a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg 's adaptation of mary gaitskill 's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out . 
it is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
mildly amusing . 
too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
it 's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . 
it 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that 's enough to sustain laughs . . .

good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it 's all over his chelsea walls . 
often silly and gross but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
adam sandler 's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures ' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
. . . although this idea is `` new `` the results are tired . 
this story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .

the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [ but ] from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold . 
the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
while this film has an 'a ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
stale and clichd to a fault . 
extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it 's still a mistake to go see it . 
a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
circuit queens wo n't learn a thing , they 'll be too busy cursing the film 's strategically placed white sheets . 
the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
an opportunity missed . 
too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ ahola ] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation . 
once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny . 
skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 
[ swimfan ] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
this movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad . 
so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . 
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
the cold turkey would 've been a far better title . 
the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
more precious than perspicacious 
while hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . 
hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
like a grinning jack o ' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us `` the skulls `` and last year 's `` rollerball . `` enough said , except : film overboard ! 
a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
with a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose . 
this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
there 's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [ b ] ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad . 
it 's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- i 'm prepared to call it a draw . 
it 's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there 's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i do n't have an i am sam clue . 
blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . 
shot perhaps 'artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
just not campy enough 
considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
. . . a pretentious mess . . . 
very well made , but does n't generate a lot of tension . 
dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we do n't even like their characters . 
the film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
in the end , there is n't much to it . 
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson 's perspective as a storyteller . 
movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [ this ] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 
i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno . 
the only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles  several of them . 
there 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves 
purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
[ a ] stuporously solemn film . 
for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 
it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 
expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies . 
the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
crikey indeed . 
. . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof . 
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory . . . but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 
control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible 
the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . `` 
a `` home alone `` film that is staged like `` rosemary 's baby , `` but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
it 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
it does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the russos ' next offering . 
the movie is as padded as allen 's jelly belly . 
this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
as saccharine as it is disposable . 
none of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny . 
the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters . 
sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
if it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent . 
to say this was done better in wilder 's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
[ t ] hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality does n't work in a modern context . 
de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen 's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this imposter . 
'enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
. . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
. . . hypnotically dull . 
simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 
offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
if you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg . 
there 's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
. . . too sappy for its own good . 
a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
for all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable . 
because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces do n't quite fit together . 
makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
the script kicks in , and mr . hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
. . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
two-bit potboiler . 
this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich 's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . 
the drama discloses almost nothing . 
the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
it 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
the plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants ' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . 
a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . 
unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
thin period piece . 
it 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
about one in three gags in white 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
even if you 're an elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style . 
shallow . 
although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 
this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow . 
possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
a movie to forget

a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
unlike trey parker , sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
it 's one long bore . 
ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clich of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears ' first movie . 
by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest can not be revived . 
occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo 's a p . o . w . 
the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . 
deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge . 
more trifle than triumph . 
here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy . 
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
it 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur ' in almost every frame . 
`martin lawrence live ' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
it 's easy to love robin tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .

charming , if overly complicated . . . 
a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
rock 's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . 
no , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 
ruh-roh ! romething 's really wrong with this ricture ! 
had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . ' 
topkapi this is not . 
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor . 
collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 
este  apenas mais um ( longo ) episdio do programa da mtv . a nica diferena  que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
barely gets off the ground . 
the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
schindler 's list it ai n't . 
bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
there 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
anyone who can count to five ( the film 's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
feel bad for king , who 's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who 's shot himself in the foot . 
the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it 's at least watchable . 
while it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject . 
some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
they threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
it 's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel is n't the actor to save it . 
i 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich . 
the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee 's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness . 
delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas . 
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
. . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
hollywood ending just is n't very funny . 
the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
 is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful . 
a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it 's just a kids ' flick . ' translation : 'we do n't need to try very hard . ' 
squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 
it 's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . 
a little too pat for its own good . 
it treats women like idiots . 
witless and utterly pointless . 
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
avary 's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis ' book . 
i 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
. . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 
every note rings false . 
. . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . 
just like hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
blue crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 
a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [ besson 's ] earlier work . 
crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
there 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
i 'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but it 's stupid . 
human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
while some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
there is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations 
as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills . 
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
the christ allegory does n't work because there is no foundation for it 
one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
it tells more than it shows . 
poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here . 
bang ! zoom ! it 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
the comedy is nonexistent . 
rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
while [ hill ] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz . 
just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
fluffy and disposible . 
a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker . 
you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
simplistic , silly and tedious . 
more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining . 
nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on `` the simpsons `` has . 
i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland 's class for the music , or to robin williams 's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . 
while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . ' 
i 've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal . 
the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
a well-acted movie that simply does n't gel . 
helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' tv and revenge . 
i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
it 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly . 
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
the script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off . 
in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship . 
we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity . 
deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
crummy 
an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
does n't add up to much . 
hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . ' 
it 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
a few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies . 
forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 
at the bottom rung of the series ' entries . 
the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime ' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
it 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental . 
most of the action setups are incoherent . 
it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you 're in need of a cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through . 
a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
. . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
the fact that the 'best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it . 
wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie 's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he 's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
ararat feels like a book report 
it 's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` got aids yet ? `` 
overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
many of benjamins ' elements feel like they 've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes . 
the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast is n't the least bit mesmerizing . 
watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
'sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it 'challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates . 
whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world 's most generic rock star . 
journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
`` looking for leonard `` just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
a pretentious mess . 
`` one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? `` um . . is n't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
collapses under its own meager weight . 
a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
odd and weird . 
has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal 's overweight and out of shape . 
harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
the premise of `` abandon `` holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess . 
kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
maybe you 'll be lucky , and there 'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie ! 
. . . really horrible drek . 
schaefer 's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and does n't know how to have fun . 
most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
what might 've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
`` feardotcom `` has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . 
a listless and desultory affair . 
the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick . 
the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
it 's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt . 
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . ' 
yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
too bad maggio could n't come up with a better script . 
really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
a major waste . . . generic . 
to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor . 
calculated swill . 
observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
a film with a great premise but only a great premise . 
disappointing in comparison to other recent war moviesor any other john woo flick for that matter . 
there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
i 'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
and people make fun of me for liking showgirls < / > . 
all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
adam sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt 
what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
it 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
for dance completists only . 
murder by numbers just does n't add up . 
the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . ' 
it 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones 's diary . 
despite its title , amy 's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
`` sorority boys `` was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
outside of burger 's desire to make some kind of film , it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken 
not only unfunny , but downright repellent . 
eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you do n't care who fires the winning shot . 
it 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
a plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
not only are the film 's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we 're -doing-it-for -the-cash ' sequel were . 
not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
`` not really as bad as you might think ! `` 
miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
a cockeyed shot all the way . 
the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
there 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . 
how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
this is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times . 
supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [ but ] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
it 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
i 'll go out on a limb . it is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it 's just merely very bad . 
the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen -- and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 
propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
feels less like a change in [ herzog 's ] personal policy than a half-hearted fluke . 
a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it 's looking for . 
we 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
what 's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that 's tv sitcom material at best . 
presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice . 
[ a ] rather thinly-conceived movie . 
a great idea becomes a not-great movie . 
truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before . 
the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage 's war-weary marine . 
with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
do you say `` hi `` to your lover when you wake up in the morning ? 
once one experiences mr . haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else . 
resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter 's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year . 
the plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling . 
it 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
'yes , that 's right : it 's forrest gump , angel of death . ' 
the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment . 
bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
sadly , 'garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . ' 
formula 51 is so trite that even yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor . 
a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i 'm not one of them .

mendes still does n't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he 's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder is n't better . 
neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn . 
has none of the crackle of `` fatal attraction `` , `` 9  weeks `` , or even `` indecent proposal `` , and feels more like lyne 's stolid remake of `` lolita `` . 
check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you do n't want to think too much about what 's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
national lampoon 's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion 
a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .

despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles . 
divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
contrived pastiche of caper clichs . 
halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy .

[ crystal and de niro ] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too . 
feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women . 
the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie 
it 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
it 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
banal and predictable . 
like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
all mood and no movie . 
flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 . 
reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
the director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff . 
why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there 's no good answer to that one . 
a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .

nothing about it fits . 
an unintentionally surreal kid 's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she 's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but does n't reveal an inner life . 
mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it . 
a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . ' 
stealing harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
`` what john does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , `` one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia . 
there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it 's not scary in the slightest . 
michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that . 
you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story . 
mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better . 
none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with `` xxx `` is that its own action is n't very effective . 
quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
it 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
it 's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
'opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down . 
essentially `` fatal attraction `` remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
a chiller resolutely without chills . 
in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic . 
the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .

my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
it 's an awfully derivative story . 
the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . 
no surprises . 
put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob 's body of work . 
we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe 's misunderstanding of marivaux 's rhythms , and mira sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress . 
sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 
all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin 's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison . 
too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 
to my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
. . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
i can imagine this movie as a b & w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . 
with zoe clarke-williams 's lackluster thriller `` new best friend `` , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
after you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . 
a one-trick pony whose few t & a bits still ca n't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable . 
despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
[ plays ] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
while there 's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer 
for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless . 
represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
it 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joff and demi moore 's the scarlet letter . 
lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . 
one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns . 
the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections . 
the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 
i ca n't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice 's novel the vampire chronicles . 
needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense . 
buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichs and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
the film is flat . 
it 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
it 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
it 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation . 
instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture 
a sour , nasty offering . 
while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances . 
an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan 's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [ seagal 's ] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
i loved looking at this movie . i just did n't care as much for the story . 
mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that 's because relatively nothing happens . 
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
we have n't seen such hilarity since say it is n't so ! 
there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew . 
the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle 's carpets . 
historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door . 
there 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
taken as a whole , the tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot . 
nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too . 
it 's not without its pleasures , but i 'll stick with the tune . 
coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit . 
initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . 
it does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 
tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . 
the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
without shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . 
in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's forget paris . but even then , i 'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
if you saw benigni 's pinocchio at a public park , you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we did n't . 
contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river 's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby 's main overall flaw . 
does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
by-the-numbers yarn . 
it 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum 's good intentions . 
. . . overly melodramatic . . . 
a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . 
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .
