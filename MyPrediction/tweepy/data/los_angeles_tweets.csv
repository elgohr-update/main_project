29,2020-06-04 23:24:09+00:00,this successful effort by the TX Attorney General to limit voting is part of the battle.  Trying to preserve power by limiting democracy even at the price of more COVID infections &amp; deaths.  High stakes.
30,2020-06-04 23:21:58+00:00,"The “normal” we want can’t &amp; should never come back. Why? That “normal” we had allowed for police brutality to happen to black people, POCs, hospitals being unprepared for a storm of covid cases &amp; needing supplies to be donated, sexual assault victims not being believed &amp;"
31,2020-06-04 23:21:51+00:00,"@yeshuatrujillo @ddiamond I think what you’re overlooking is that scientists aren’t saying protesting = good now. They’re still warning about covid, social distancing, best practices. They are simply being realistic that we can’t just tell POC to keep letting us kill them in silence."

30,2020-09-01 23:38:02+00:00,184K covid deaths in the US. If the stats are correct about a majority having pre existing health issues that leaves big pharma/doctors out of $ from unfilled prescriptions.
